# Rosalind 2022 🚀🧬

A personal project to solve the **Rosalind** bioinformatics challenges using Python — one problem at a time. This repo tracks my progress, notes, and learnings while tackling various problems from the Rosalind platform.

## 📌 Legend

- `C` ✅ — Completed/Correct  
- `***` 🚧 — Haven’t attempted  
- `**` 🐛 — Almost done, but debugging needed  
- `**********` 😅 — Borrowed someone else’s code (couldn’t crack it myself — will revisit)  
- `[notes: ]` 📝 — Any specific observations or things I learned
